EZ-PZ-PW will store your passwords for all your online accounts, while you only have to remember one password for your EZ-PZ-PW account! EZ-PZ-PW can also generate extremely secure passwords for your accounts to prevent any unwanted activity with your accounts. EZ-PZ-PW encrypts your password bank so that nobody other than yourself will be able to access them. \n",
